\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9-0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Now natively supports multiple chains running in parallel.
      \item Objects fit by \code{bart} can be used with the predict generic
      when instructed to save the trees.
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{dbartsControl} has had two parameters renamed: \code{numSamples}
      is now \code{defaultNumSamples} and \code{numBurnIn} is now
      \code{defaultNumBurnIn}.
      \item \code{dbartsControl} supports parameters \code{runMode},
      \code{n.chains}, \code{rngKind} and \code{rngNormalKind}.
      \item In the C interface, a new function (\code{setRNGState}) has been
      added to specify the states of the random number generators, of which there
      is now one for every chain.
      \item State objects saved by the handles no longer contain the total
      fits, since they can be rebuild from the tree fits. States are also lists
      of objects now, with one corresponding to each chain. Tree fits and strings
      are matrices corresponding to the number of trees and saved samples.

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8-6}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item random subsampling crossvalidation (\code{xbart}) has been implemented
      in C++. Refits model using current set of trees for changes in
      hyperparameters \code{n.trees}, \code{k}, \code{power}, and \code{base}.
      Natively parallelized.
      \item Rudimentary tree plotting added to sampler (\code{sampler$plotTree}).
      \item Exported \code{dbartsData} as a way of constructing data objects
      and setting the data seen by the sampler all at once. Sampler now supports
      \code{sampler$setData()}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{keepevery} argument to \code{bart} matches \code{BayesTree}.
      \item \code{bart} now has argument \code{keepcall} to suppress
      storing the call object.
      \item \code{bart} now accepts a \code{weights} argument.
      \item \code{MakeModelMatrixFromDataFrame} now implemented in C, supports
      an argument for tracking/keeping dropped values from factors.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUG-FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Usage of weights was causing incorrect updates to posterior for
      \eqn{\sigma^2}.
      \item Should now JIT byte compile correctly.
      \item Cuts derived from quantiles should now be valid.
    }
  }
}    
\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8-4}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Uses a rejection sampler to simulated binary latent variables
      (CP Robert 2009, http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4010.pdf). Code thanks to
      Jared Murray.
      \item Now encapsulates its own random number generator, so that the C++
      objects can safely be used in parallel. Shouldn't affect pure-R users 
      unless their RNG has non-exported state (i.e. Box-Muller normal kind).
      \item Includes a \code{offset.test} vector that can be controlled 
      independently of the \code{offset} vector, but in general inherits
      behavior from it. Set at creation with \code{dbarts()} or after
      with \code{setTestOffset} or \code{setTestPredictorAndOffset}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{USER-VISIBLE CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item By default, no longer attempts to obtain identical results as
      BayesTree. To recover this behavior, compile from source with 
      \code{configure.args = "--enable-match-bayes-tree"}.
      \item Changing the entirety of the test matrix using \code{setTestPredictor}
      no longer allowed. Use \code{setTestPredictors} instead.
      \item Changing the predictor can now result in failure if the covariates
      would leave an end-node empty. \code{setPredictor} returns a logical
      as to success.
      \item Saved \code{dbarts} objects may not be compatible and should be
      re-created to be sure of valdity.
      \item Now requires R versions >= 3.1.0.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Corrected binary latent variable sampler and no longer multiply
      adds offset (reported by Jared Murray).
      \item Relatively embarassing bug related to loop-unrolling when \code{n mod 5 != 0}
      fixed.
      \item Correct aggregation of results for multithreaded variance calculations.
      \item More equitably distributed tasks across multiple threads.
      \item Makevars tweaked to allow compilation on Ubuntu.
