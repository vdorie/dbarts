Description: Fits Bayesian additive regression trees (BART; Chipman, George, and McCulloch (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS285>) while allowing the updating of predictors or response so that BART can be incorporated as a conditional model in a Gibbs/MH sampler. Also serves as a drop-in replacement for package 'BayesTree'.
